## Summary âœ¨
A chat app that allows users to communicate with each other in real-time. Users can create channels, join them, and
send messages. They can further delete or edit their messages and also delete channels. To simplify and put more focus
on the real-time aspect of the app, there are no proper user accounts and authentication. Users can be impersonated easy
and it is up to the user to choose a unique username. The app is built with `.NET 7` and `React`.

## Details ðŸ”Ž
As a part of my BCIT C# course, this project is meant to teach us how to use `SignalR` to implement real-time features.
The app is built with `.NET 7` (`C#`), `React` (`TypeScript`), and `daisyUI` (`Tailwind CSS`), and is deployed on `Railway` for which
I have an article that you can read <a target="_blank" href="https://iliabedian.com/blog/deploy-dotnet-app-on-railway-with-docker/">here</a>.

## Challenges ðŸ¥µ
Deploying the app on `Railway` was a bit of a challenge since I couldn't find any proper documentation or tutorials on
how to do it. I had to figure it out by experimenting and reading `Railway` documentation.

## Takeaway ðŸ“–
I definitely learned so much about `Railway CLI` to deploy the app. That also lead to writing a blog post and sharing my
solution with the community. I also learned a lot about `ASP.NET`'s APIs. I worked with `SignalR` before hand, but this
was a good refresher.

`Tailwind` was as amazing as always. Didn't learn anything new except using `daisyUI` plugin, which was kind of fun.
I highly recommend checking them out if you haven't already. <a target="_blank" href="https://daisyui.com/">daisyUI</a>
