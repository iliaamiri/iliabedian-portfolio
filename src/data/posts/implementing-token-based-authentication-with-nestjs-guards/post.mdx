There are times that you don't necessarily care about having a stateful authentication and your microservice is going to be used internally by
other services. But, you still want to make sure that even if your internal microservice got discovered, bad actors will still
need a key to use your service! üîë

> A door that can be locked is better than an open door if you have some private things going on in there, you know.

Let's dig in. ([skip to the code](#show-me-code))

<Note>For clarification, here's a diagram that shows how the authentication process is going to work:</Note>

<img src={Image_ArchDemo.src} alt={'Demonstration of the Architecture. Shows a diagram of two entities: ' +
  '- An External Consumer that wants to consume your Microservice' +
  '- Your microservice' +
  'The diagram shows that the consumer sends a requests to the microservice with an Authorization header with the value of ' +
  'Bearer <your token>'} height={'300'} className={'w-full block'} />

<Note>
You will need a strong token that is hard to guess. Just like picking a strong password, make sure it's super long
but not too long to make the RAM go burr üòµ‚Äçüí´

A great candidate would be `zIA;!I}#4FI~IcK9K_aIqT{:hW"KPp0pcxKzT^AH5hG'Y%*ZE{__q6~9[3t,q_J` as an example which can be my
Wi-Fi password.
</Note>

<Note type="warning">
Keep in mind that a token-based authentication is useful when your server is not super on the surface and publicly
accessible. If security is crucial to your solution or project, consider implementing a more secure method such as JSON Web Token (JWT)
</Note>

## Setup the project
Here's how I setup the project:

### 1. Install NestJS and the required additional dependencies
```bash
$ npx @nestjs/cli new project-name

$ cd project-name
$ npm run start

  # to allow reading the token from configurations
$ npm i --save @nestjs/config
```

### 2. Setup the Configuration module of NestJS
You can read more on the original documentation here.

Simply added this to the `imports` array in my `app.module.ts`:
`ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true }),`

  <p id="show-me-code"></p>

A view of my `app.module.ts`:
```typescript
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppController } from './app.controller';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { ConfigModule } from '@nestjs/config';

@Module({
  imports: [
    ConfigModule.forRoot({ isGlobal: true }),
  ],
  controllers: [AppController],
  providers: [AppService],
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Adding the Guard
Now, NestJs doesn't just support middlewares. <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/guards" target="_blank">Guards</a> in '
  NestJs are special classes that are used for a **single responsiblity** of deciding whether or not the incoming request
  should continue or rejected with an _Unauthorized status_.

Instead of setting up a barebone middleware to check whether a user is authorized to use the service, a guard makes your life easier
by letting you return a `boolean` to either allow or block the request.

<Note>I'm reading the value of the secret token from an `.env` file.</Note>
```env
API_SECRET_KEY="<a random secure key>"
```

In order to add a new Guard, make a new file in your codebase (anywhere under `src` folder) and add this content inside of it:
```typescript
import { Injectable, CanActivate, ExecutionContext } from '@nestjs/common';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { ConfigService } from '@nestjs/config';

@Injectable()
export class AuthTokenGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(private configService: ConfigService) {}

  canActivate(context: ExecutionContext): boolean | Promise<boolean> | Observable<boolean> {
    const request = context.switchToHttp().getRequest();

    const bearerToken = request.headers.authorization;
    if (!bearerToken) {
      return false;
    }

    const apiSecretKey = this.configService.get<string>('API_SECRET_KEY');

    const token = bearerToken.split(' ')[1];
    return !(!token || token !== apiSecretKey);
  }
}
```
<Note>The location of the file depends on your preference and opinion on how to orgnaize your codebase.</Note>
<Note>By convention, the NestJS community goes with this file format: `*.guard.ts`. I named my file `authToken.guard.ts`. However,
  it's merely a naming convention choice.</Note>

## Using the Guard
Now, you can globally bind the Guard by adding the second line in your `main.ts` file:
```typescript
const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
app.useGlobalGuards(new AuthTokenGuard());
```
This will make sure that all requests from any protocol will hit your Guard and your Guard will reject the request if
there are no `Bearer token` in the request headers, or the token does not match with the one in your `.env`.

<Note>
  Read more on NestJS' documentation on <a href="https://docs.nestjs.com/guards#binding-guards" target="_blank">other ways that you can bind a Guard</a>
