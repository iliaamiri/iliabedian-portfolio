I love debuggers. Even though sometimes I log to the console, I lean more towards using debuggers. A quote from unknown:
> When you're not using a debugger, it's like trying to navigate in the dark.

This is not a cult by any means. But, I really think that more people should start using debuggers. My guess is that they
don't feel confident setting up the debugger because they think it's a difficult process and takes their time.

Every time I talked with some other developers about debuggers, the majority started arguing why logging to the console is
better than debuggers.

And by "other developers" I mean most of the JavaScript community. Although I've seen a few people who
actually like using debuggers, I'm still in this belief that most of them prefer not using them.

## Why should you use a debugger?
Furiously logging things to your console can sometimes be tiring. Haven't you ever written swear words in your console?
```js
console.log("AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA FREAKING BISH", user, user.friends);

console.log("I'm malding", user)
console.log("@*%%^#$#$(", req.cookie)
console.log("******", user.password) // ðŸ¤¦
```

Like, I just wanna know what's `user` in my code. Is that why it's not working? Or is it because of `user.friends`? I don't know.
If I use a debugger, all I have to do is to click next to the line where I'm reading the value of `user` to set a breakpoint.

And, next time I run my app, not only I can see the value of `user` and it's ancestors, but I could also move line-by-line.

## When should you even use a debugger?
You should use a debugger as much as you can. If the project allows you to use a debugger in a sense that it doesn't make
your workflow slower, then you should definitely use it.

Sometimes, using a debugger is not the best idea. For example, if you're developing a fast-paced real-time application (e.g. multiplayer games),
using a debugger is almost impossible. In this case, you kind of have to use logging to the console. But, let's say you are
developing a software that doesn't require real-time interaction as much. Or if it does, it's slow and there are not so many
events that are simultaneously happening.

## How to use it?
<Note type='warning'>
This article won't cover how to setup a specific debugger. It rather focuses on how to use a debugger once you set it up.
Depending on your programming language and your project environment, you'll need to find your debugger and actually take the time
and read their instructions.
</Note>

### Setting a breakpoint
Setting a breakpoint is easy. All you have to do is to click on the line number where you want to set a breakpoint. If you're
using VSCode, you can also click on the left side of the line number to set a breakpoint. It's the same thing.

### Running the debugger
Once you set a breakpoint, you can run your app. Hit that play button or the button with a bug icon. Usually, your editor
should give a hint of what key combination you should use to run the debugger. For example, in VSCode, you can use `F5` to
run the debugger. It could vary depending on your editor.

### Debugging
Now, let's say I'm debugging a JavaScript file.

<img src={Image_Showcasing.src} height="400" width="9000" />

Notice how the debugger stopped at the line where I set a breakpoint. Now, I can see everything!

Now, I have a few options to play with:

1. Step over: This will move to the next line. If the next line is a function call, it won't go inside the function and
will just move to the next line.
2. Step in: If you want to go inside a function, you can use this.
3. Step out: If you're inside a function and want to go back to the caller, you can use this.

<Note type='info'>
And, I recommend using the keyboard shortcuts for these. It's much easier and faster than clicking on the buttons.
</Note>

Here's some points that I want to highlight:

- If I wish, I could also change the value of a variable in runtime.
- I have the power to mute my breakpoints. This is useful if I want to run my app without stopping at a breakpoint.
- If I have a `console.log`, I can still see the output in the console. But, I can also see the output in the debugger.
- I can see every variable in my scope. I can also see the value of the variable by hovering over it.

## Conclusion
Again, I'm not saying that you should use a debugger all the time. But, if you're not using a debugger at all, you should
probably start using it. What I always tell people is that, _using a debugger can prevent your hair from turning grey_.

I hope you enjoyed this article. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter.

I'd love to hear your rant and swear words about me using a debugger. Just kidding. I'd love to hear your thoughts about this
whole debugger thing. Do you use a debugger? If not, why? If yes, why? Let me know on Twitter.
