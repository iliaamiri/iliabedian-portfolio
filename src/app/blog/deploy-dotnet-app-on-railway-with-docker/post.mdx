**Deploy a .NET app on Railway**
**Before starting, make sure you have: **
- Installed .NET 7 sdk.
- Installed Docker and ran its service.
- Installed Railway CLI from https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli

Dockerfile (Auto-generated by Rider IDE):
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["MyApp/MyApp.csproj", "MyApp/"]
RUN dotnet restore "MyApp/MyApp.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/MyApp"
RUN dotnet build "MyApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "MyApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "MyApp.dll"]
```

Imagining this is our app's source code:
/MyApp
--/MyApp
----/[*Your MyApp project source code*]
--/MyApp.sln

make a `railway.toml` file under `/MyApp` and with this content:
```toml
[build]
builder = "dockerfile"
dockerfilePath = "./MyApp/Dockerfile"

[deploy]
startCommand = "dotnet MyApp.dll"
restartPolicyType = "never"
```

Go to your `Program.cs` at `/MyApp/MyApp/Program.cs`. And, add these two lines before `var app = builder.Build();` :
```csharp
var port = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("PORT") ?? "8081";
builder.WebHost.UseUrls($"http://0.0.0.0:{port}");
```
:warning:**NOTE**: comment out the line that forces HTTPS redirection. (`app.UseHttpsRedirection();`) in your `Program.cs`.

**2. Railway Moment**

2.0 navigate to `/MyApp` folder in your command line shell.

2.1 run `railway login` and follow the instructions to login on your railway account.

2.2 (optional) run `railway run dotnet run --project ./MyApp` and make sure that your app is running (local)

2.3 On your railway, "Start a New Project" and then choose the "Empty project" from the dropdown menu.

2.4 Add a Service. and choose "Empty Service".

2.5 On you terminal, (staying in the `/MyApp` working directory), run `railway link` and then choose your project that you want to link your .NET app to. (There will be a list of your railway projects by their names.)

2.6 Finally, run `railway up` and wait until your deployment builds, and deploys on railway. You can checkout the deployment starting on your Railway project (service) deployment page.

2.7 And maybe generate a new domain so that you can access your app via that.

if anyone is having their solution and project in the same folder, here's how your Dockerfile should almost look like:
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:7.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80
EXPOSE 443

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:7.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["BallApp.csproj", "./"]
RUN dotnet restore "BallApp.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/"
RUN dotnet build "BallApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

FROM build AS publish
RUN dotnet publish "BallApp.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "BallApp.dll"]
```
