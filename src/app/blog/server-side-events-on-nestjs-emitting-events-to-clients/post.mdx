Have you ever wanted to send real-time updates to your clients without the need for a WebSocket connection? If so, then
Server-Sent Events (SSE) is the perfect solution for you. In this blog, I'll show you how to implement this solution in a NestJS application.

## What are Server-Sent Events?
Unlike WebSockets, SSE is a unidirectional communication protocol. This means that the server can only send data to the client,
but the client cannot send data back to the server. This is a great solution for use cases where the client only needs to receive some
data from the server, but not send any data back.

SSE is a part of the HTML5 specification and is supported by all modern browsers. It is also supported by Node.js, which makes it a great
solution for building real-time applications with NestJS.

## Setting up the NestJS server

Before diving into the implementation, let's set up a new NestJS project and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually bundled with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Creating a new NestJS project

To create a new NestJS project, first, install the Nest CLI globally on your system by running:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

Next, use the `nest new` command to create a new project. Replace `nestjs-sse-example` with your desired project name:

```bas
nest new nestjs-sse-example
```

Follow the prompts, and choose the package manager you prefer (npm or Yarn). The CLI will generate a new NestJS project with the default structure and configuration.

## Installing dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd nestjs-sse-example
npm i
npm i --save @nestjs/event-emitter # for the event emitter
```

The default NestJS installation already includes the necessary dependencies, such as `@nestjs/core`, `@nestjs/common`,
and `rxjs`. No additional dependencies are required for this example.

## Starting the development server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This will start the NestJS development server with hot-reload enabled. You should see the following output indicating that the server is running:
```bash
[nestjs] Starting Nest application...
[nestjs] Nest application successfully started
```

Now that the NestJS server is set up and running accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:3000](http://127.0.0.1:3000), we can proceed to create an SSE endpoint in `app.controller.ts` made by the Nest CLI as
a boilerplate.

<Note type='info'>
The way I'm going to implement this example is by creating an SSE endpoint that pipes the triggered event of `sse.event` to the response stream using
`fromEvent` from `rxjs`. This way, we can trigger the event from anywhere in the application and the client will receive the data.
</Note>

```typescript
import { Controller, Sse, MessageEvent } from '@nestjs/common';
import { AppService } from './app.service';
import { EventEmitter2 } from '@nestjs/event-emitter';
import { Observable, fromEvent, map } from 'rxjs';

@Controller()
export class AppController {
  constructor(
    private readonly appService: AppService,
    private eventEmitter: EventEmitter2,
  ) {}

  @Sse('/sse')
  async sse(): Promise<Observable<MessageEvent>> {
    return fromEvent(this.eventEmitter, 'sse.event').pipe(
      map((payload) => ({
        data: JSON.stringify(payload),
      })),
    );
  }
}
```



The `@Sse` decorator is used to create an SSE endpoint. The `sse` method returns an `Observable` from `rxjs` that emits the `MessageEvent` object to the client.
The `MessageEvent` object contains the `data` property that is sent to the client. In this example, we are sending the `payload` object emitted by the
`sse.event` event.

<Note>
The `MessageEvent` is imported from `@nestjs/common` and is not the same as the `MessageEvent` from the [DOM API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/MessageEvent).
</Note>

Now, let's go to `app.service.ts` and create a method that will trigger the `sse.event` event:

```typescript
import { Injectable, OnModuleInit } from '@nestjs/common';
import { EventEmitter2 } from '@nestjs/event-emitter';

@Injectable()
export class AppService implements OnModuleInit {
  constructor(private eventEmitter: EventEmitter2) {}

  onModuleInit() {
    setInterval(async () => {
      this.sse();
    }, 3000);
  }

  async sse() {
    this.eventEmitter.emit('sse.event', {
      message: 'Hello from the server',
      randomNumber: Math.random(),
    });
  }
}
```

The `onModuleInit` method is called when the module is initialized. In this example, we are using it to trigger the `sse` method every 3 seconds.

## Testing the SSE endpoint with a client
We're going to use a minimal [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) that hosts static files to test the SSE endpoint.

### Setting up the client
First, create a new directory called `client` and navigate to it and install express:

```bash
mkdir client
cd client

npm i express
```

Next, create a new file called `app.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');

const app = express();

// Serve static files from the public directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));

const port = 8888;

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log('Server accessible on http://127.0.0.1:' + port);
});
```

This will start the Express server accessible at [http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888) and serve the static files from the `public` directory.

Next, create a new directory called `public` and create a new file called `index.html` in it. Add the following code to the file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>SSE Client</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Server-Sent Events (SSE) Client</h1>
  <div id="events">
    <h2>Events:</h2>
    <ul id="event-list">
    </ul>
  </div>
  <script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      const eventList = document.getElementById('event-list');

      const source = new EventSource('http://localhost:3000/sse');

      source.onmessage = function (event) {
        const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
        const li = document.createElement('li');
        li.textContent = JSON.stringify(data);
        eventList.appendChild(li);
      };

      source.onerror = function (error) {
        console.error('EventSource error:', error);
      };
    });
  </script>
</body>

</html>
```

This will create a simple HTML page that will connect to the SSE endpoint and display the received events in a list.
The `EventSource` interface is used to connect to the SSE endpoint. The `onmessage` event is triggered when the client receives a new event from the server.

<Note>
You can read more about the `EventSource` interface [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource).
</Note>

### Running the client
To run the client, navigate to the `client` directory and run the following command:

```bash
node app.js
```

This will start the Express server and serve the static files from the `public` directory. You should see the following output in the terminal:
```bash
Server accessible on http://127.0.0.1:8888
```

Now, open [http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888) in your browser and you should see the following page:

<Image src={Image_Result} width={900} height={200} className='w-full' />

Congratulations! You have successfully created an SSE endpoint in your NestJS application. You can now trigger the
`sse.event` event from anywhere in the application and the client will receive the data.
