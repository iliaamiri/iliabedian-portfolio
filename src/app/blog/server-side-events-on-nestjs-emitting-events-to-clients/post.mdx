In today's fast-paced digital world, real-time communication and data streaming play a crucial role in creating engaging
and interactive web applications. NestJS, a popular and powerful framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications, combined with Server-Sent Events (SSE), can take your web app's real-time capabilities to new heights.

In this article, we will demonstrate how to harness the power of NestJS and SSE to create real-time data streaming
between a server and clients. You will learn about the key concepts of NestJS and Server-Sent Events, along with a step-by-step guide to setting up a NestJS server and client-side code for seamless data streaming.

Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to expand your skillset or a newcomer to the world of real-time web applications,
this article will provide you with valuable insights and practical examples to jumpstart your journey into the world of NestJS and SSE.

## Setting up the NestJS server

Before diving into the implementation, let's set up a new NestJS project and install the required dependencies.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v12 or newer)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually bundled with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Creating a new NestJS project

To create a new NestJS project, first, install the Nest CLI globally on your system by running:

```bash
npm install -g @nestjs/cli
```

Next, use the `nest new` command to create a new project. Replace `nestjs-sse-example` with your desired project name:

```bas
nest new nestjs-sse-example
```

Follow the prompts, and choose the package manager you prefer (npm or Yarn). The CLI will generate a new NestJS project with the default structure and configuration.

## Installing dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd nestjs-sse-example
```

The default NestJS installation already includes the necessary dependencies, such as `@nestjs/core`, `@nestjs/common`,
and `rxjs`. No additional dependencies are required for this example.

## Starting the development server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

This will start the NestJS development server with hot-reload enabled. You should see the following output indicating that the server is running:
```bash
[nestjs] Starting Nest application...
[nestjs] Nest application successfully started
```

Now that the NestJS server is set up and running, we can proceed to create the service and controller for managing Server-Sent Events.
