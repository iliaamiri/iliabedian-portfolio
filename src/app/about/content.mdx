An enthusiastic self-driven full-stack web developer with a focus in Back-End. I enjoy both working in teams and collaborating on personal projects.

I like solving complex problems and building new things at an enterprise degree. I like arguing about scalability,
foreseeing problems and preventing them, trying new approaches, writing clean code, pair programming, mentoring, and consulting.

As a teammember, I pay attention to the details, maintain a healthy team workflow, give space to my teammates to grow,
enjoy working with chill folks, and people who know more than me.

[//]: # (## Background)

[//]: # (I'm an only child in my family and lived most of my life moving around to different places because of my parents' jobs.)

[//]: # (When I was a kindergartener, I got stutter trying to imitate another kid's way of talking which was stuttering. And,)

[//]: # (it stuck to me ever since. Having stutter blocked me from developing basic social skills and ingrained awkwardness and many)

[//]: # (other bad traits into my perspective and personality. I'm still working on treating my stutter and identifying those traits and striving)

[//]: # (to be a better person.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Stutter also made an introvert out of me and caused me to have lack of self-esteem and many other bad personality traits.)

[//]: # (I truly believe I would've a different path if I didn't have this phenomenon during my youth. I might've not become a programmer)

[//]: # (although I love doing it.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (The only reason I became super open about my stutter and understood it is because of a rare speech therapy I used to go at.)

[//]: # (Although I went to a bunch of speech therapists, the last one was the only legitimate and effective one who truly gave me)

[//]: # (the ability to accept my stutter and understand it fully.)

[//]: # (## The Story of My Programming Journey)

[//]: # (This is a long one so sit back and grab some snacks before reading it.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (When I was 13, I initially dipped my toes into the world of programming by trying to learn how to program. So,)

[//]: # (I downloaded some PDFs to learn Python and Ruby on my dad's computer. And, I got discouraged because I didn't know what a variable)

[//]: # (is and couldn't understand even after I asked my father. He told me to learn Visual Basic as it has to do with visuals and)

[//]: # (forms on Windows so it would be a great way to start. I made a simple form and input, but still couldn't understand anything)

[//]: # (cause I was too young. A few months later, I clung to my dad and begged him to buy me a laptop. And he made the mistake.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (When I turned 14, I started my real programming journey while trying to become a &#40;cool&#41; hacker.. But, thankfully,)

[//]: # (my uncle showed me the roadmap and moved me towards being a Web Developer! So, I listened to his guidance and)

[//]: # (started learning about basic Web concepts. I googled the basic web concepts and buzz words that he told me.)

[//]: # ("What is Web?", "What is HTTP?", "What happens when someone opens a web page", and so on. I read so many different blogs)

[//]: # (to truly understand each individual concept.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Then I tried learning HTML on my own, but my brain was too small, so I decided to sign up at a programming academy in)

[//]: # (Tehran, and take things from there. I studied super hard for HTML and CSS while my friends were playing PS4 all day.)

[//]: # (I coded out the UIs of a few web pages for practice &#40;e.g.: Facebook login page, DigiKala's homepage, MacDonald's homepage, Apple's homepage, etc.&#41;.)

[//]: # (Then I decided to learn one of the most loved programming languages in the world. PHP. Again, I ended up going to another academy)

[//]: # (somewhere else in Tehran along with one of my friends to learn this beautiful language.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (I began building personal projects with PHP and I somehow could understand more things and I self-studied more advanced)

[//]: # (concepts in PHP. Then I started building more projects for my friends, family, and freelancing. I made my own)

[//]: # (PHP framework because I didn't want to learn any frameworks back then! It was not the best decision even though it was super fun.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Despite not being the first, PHP was my stepping stone to learn other concepts &#40;OOP, interfaces&#41; and languages such as:)

[//]: # (C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and C++. Not an impressive stepping stone but whatever.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (When I went to college, I met lots of peers and actually worked in teams of more than 2 people. I learned the basics of)

[//]: # (Operation Systems, Databases, and Programming once more which really reinforced those stuff for me at a basic level. I)

[//]: # (think going to a college was super nice because of this. Maybe that's why some jobs require you to have a degree.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (Currently, I'm pursuing my career more professionally and looking for opportunities to challenge myself and)

[//]: # (help others learn things I wish someone else would've told me to learn.)
