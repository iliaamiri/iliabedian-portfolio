I'm Eiliya (ilia). The former is my legal name! But, I much prefer writing it as "Ilia", since it's easier.
You might ask why. Let's just say, someone misspelled the english version on my passport. It's true. I'm originally from
Iran but currently living in Canada.

I love computers. I enjoy building software and sharing my journey of programming with the world while keep
learning about new things. I listen to a variety of music, watch drama and war movies but even then, I just like movies.
I'm very flexible with my hobbies. I also like hiking. Who knows what else I'll do. I'm not a robot so what you read can
never fully represent who I am at the moment. As Heraclitus quotes:

> "No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man."

I also like philosophy by the way. I mean who doesn't üòè

Come and say hi or chat anytime through either of my socials. I'd love to hear about your journey and anything that you
might want to share with me that has to do with my content or anything ü§ó

## Background
I'm an only child in my family and lived most of my life moving around to different places because of my parents' jobs.
When I was a kindergartener, I got stutter trying to imitate another kid's way of talking which was stuttering. And,
it stuck to me ever since. Having stutter blocked me from developing basic social skills and ingrained awkwardness and many
other bad traits into my perspective and personality. I'm still working on treating my stutter and identifying those traits and striving
to be a better person.

Stutter also made an introvert out of me and caused me to have lack of self-esteem and many other bad personality traits.
I truly believe I would've a different path if I didn't have this phenomenon during my youth. I might've not become a programmer
although I love doing it.

The only reason I became super open about my stutter and understood it is because of a rare speech therapy I used to go at.
Although I went to a bunch of speech therapists, the last one was the only legitimate and effective one who truly gave me
the ability to accept my stutter and understand it fully.

## The Story of My Programming Journey
This is a long one so sit back and grab some snacks before reading it.

When I was 13, I initially dipped my toes into the world of programming by trying to learn how to program. So,
I downloaded some PDFs to learn Python and Ruby on my dad's computer. And, I got discouraged because I didn't know what a variable
is and couldn't understand even after I asked my father. He told me to learn Visual Basic as it has to do with visuals and
forms on Windows so it would be a great way to start. I made a simple form and input, but still couldn't understand anything
cause I was too young. A few months later, I clung to my dad and begged him to buy me a laptop. And he made the mistake.

When I turned 14, I started my real programming journey while trying to become a (cool) hacker.. But, thankfully,
my uncle showed me the roadmap and moved me towards being a Web Developer! So, I listened to his guidance and
started learning about basic Web concepts. I googled the basic web concepts and buzz words that he told me.
"What is Web?", "What is HTTP?", "What happens when someone opens a web page", and so on. I read so many different blogs
to truly understand each individual concept.

Then I tried learning HTML on my own, but my brain was too small, so I decided to sign up at a programming academy in
Tehran, and take things from there. I studied super hard for HTML and CSS while my friends were playing PS4 all day.
I coded out the UIs of a few web pages for practice (e.g.: Facebook login page, DigiKala's homepage, MacDonald's homepage, Apple's homepage, etc.).
Then I decided to learn one of the most loved programming languages in the world. PHP. Again, I ended up going to another academy
somewhere else in Tehran along with one of my friends to learn this beautiful language.

I began building personal projects with PHP and I somehow could understand more things and I self-studied more advanced
concepts in PHP. Then I started building more projects for my friends, family, and freelancing. I made my own
PHP framework because I didn't want to learn any frameworks back then! It was not the best decision even though it was super fun.

Despite not being the first, PHP was my stepping stone to learn other concepts (OOP, interfaces) and languages such as:
C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and C++. Not an impressive stepping stone but whatever.

When I went to college, I met lots of peers and actually worked in teams of more than 2 people. I learned the basics of
Operation Systems, Databases, and Programming once more which really reinforced those stuff for me at a basic level. I
think going to a college was super nice because of this. Maybe that's why some jobs require you to have a degree.

Currently, I'm pursuing my career more professionally and looking for opportunities to challenge myself and
help others learn things I wish someone else would've told me to learn.

Feel free to drop me a message about anything you want to talk about, or simply say hi and chat with me if you want! üòä
