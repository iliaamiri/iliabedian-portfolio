## Summary âœ¨

## Details ðŸ”Ž
Tactical Pigeons is a fun turn based online game where you attack, defend, and steal food from rival pigeons. The interdisciplinary
 term project in our second semester at BCIT using the foundational skills we learned so far.

Collaborating in a team of 4, we had 1 month to plan, work with a team of designers, and develop the game from scratch.
Due to the requirements of this project, we ended up using `Vanilla JavaScript`, `Experss.js`, `Node.js`, and `MySQL` to build this game.
We also used `Socket.io` to implement the multiplayer functionality of the game.

## My role ðŸ«¡
As a Full-Stack Developer in this project, I suggested using the MVC design pattern, collaborated with 3 other
 developers to plan and implement the game, implemented the database, helped with hosting the server on `Heroku` and `Railway`,
 integrated the real-time gameplay logic by connecting the frontend to the backend utilizing `JavaScript Event API`,
 installed and configured `Webpack` to bundle the frontend code, helped with the frontend design and styling,
 and supported my team members with any issues they had.

## Challenges ðŸ¥µ
### Collaborating with the Designers
Working with the designers was a challenge as we couldn't communicate with them efficiently due to their busy schedules
and different campus locations. Although we didn't stop working on the project, we were a little worried that we wouldn't
have the required assets to finish the game on time.

### Working as a Team
Before this project, I had never worked in a team of more than 2 people. Lacking teamwork experience and collaborating
on a single project with 3 other people was a challenge for me at first, since I had a faulty and egoistic mindset that I didn't need
to collaborate with them and take things into my own hands! But, I ended up loving it!

## Takeaway ðŸ“–
> A team can ideate and accomplish more than what an individual can ever come up with or imagine. And, trusting your
 teammates is en essential element of teamwork.

This experience truly changed me and my perspective. I discovered the value of trusting my teammates and experienced the
remarkable outcomes that collaboration can yield. Had I been the sole individual tackling this project, the notions we
developed collectively would've been unattainable. While completing the project on time was not an issue for me,
I had to consider what mattered more: adhering to deadlines with a mediocre concept, or delving into innovative and
unconventional ideas? I opted for the latter.
