## General info

Welcome to Coughie, This app was created as an assignment for BCIT. We developed it from the ground up, starting with the idea and then creating a style guide for the logo, font, icons, and color scheme. We then built a mock version of the app using Figma, before using a new framework called prereact to build the actual app, which was a great opportunity for us to become familiar with a different framework.

## Features

Share your progress in quitting vaping with others and track your progress with this app.
It will be represented as a plant growing - the more you quit, the more the plant will grow.
You can also search for products to buy with the money you save, and find communities to join. The bigger the community, the more support you will have. You can also change your profile image, and all data will be saved in your local storage.
